### Sun-Standard

**The Future of Secure Communication, Built Today.**

Sun-Standard is a next-generation communication protocol designed to be fundamentally secure, private, and anonymous. It addresses the critical vulnerabilities of current internet standards by employing a **quantum-resilient** architecture and an **Aetheric Weave** for untraceable routing. This project aims to establish a new benchmark for digital privacy in an era of growing surveillance and quantum computing threats.

### Key Features

* **Post-Quantum Cryptography:** Protects data against attacks from future quantum computers.
* **Dynamic Anonymity Engine:** Ensures sender and receiver identities are completely obscured.
* **Decentralized-by-Design:** Operates without a central authority, enhancing resilience and trust.

### In Development

This repository currently hosts the foundational concepts for the Sun-Standard protocol. A comprehensive whitepaper detailing the cryptographic and architectural principles is in active preparation. The reference implementation, SDK, and documentation will follow shortly.

Stay tuned for updates as we build the new standard for a safer digital world.
